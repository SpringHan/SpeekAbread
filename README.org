   You can edit ~/usr/local/src/seek/VoiceWake.py~, these are voice wake-up code part.

   And read the comments to edit the source codes.

** Example
   After we runned the ~make init~ command, we can find SpeekABread folder at ~.config~ folder.
   
   The custom scripts will save in it.

   Continue I'll create an easy script to open Netease Cloud Music.
   #+begin_src shell
     $ vim 网易云音乐.sh
   #+end_src
   Because now only Chinese and simple English can be support, So please try to rename a Chinese name.
   #+begin_src shell
     #!/bin/bash
     netease-cloud-music &
   #+end_src
   The code is so easy! And after run the ~Spread~ execute file, You just say ~打开网易云音乐~, and it's opened the Netease Cloud Music!
   
   *Note*: ~Spread~ is a command to run speech recognition directly, And ~SpeekABread~ contain the voice wake-up function.
